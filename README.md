# guards_stats
A place to keep statistics for Guards of Atlantis 2

Statistics generated based on play-testing data up through 2023/12/23.

The visualization below shows how good/bad heroes are at working together. The small circles on the edges are win/loss ratios close to 1 - that is, when those two heroes are on a team together they win about the same number of games as they lose. Bigger circles mean a better win/loss ratio.

The visualization below shows the easiest/hardest opponents for specific heroes. The small circles on the edges are win/loss ratios close to 1 - that is, when those two heroes are on opposite teams, the number of wins is roughly the same as the number of losses. Bigger circles mean a better win/loss ratio for the first hero listed. For instance, Mortimer v. Brogan as a bigger circle means that when Mortimer and Brogan are on opposite teams, Mortimer has won more games than Brogan has.
